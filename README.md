# CarDealer-SCSS-Animation

Welcome to the CarDealer-SCSS-Animation project! This project was created as a learning journey to explore the capabilities of SCSS (Sass) and its use in creating animations for a car dealership website.
Installation

To use this project, you will need to have the following software installed on your computer:

  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
  - [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

Once you have these tools installed, you can clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies by running the following commands:

    git clone https://github.com/jamieblomerus/CarDealer-SCSS-Animation.git

    npm install

## Usage
